## Craftsman Contact

#### Pet project

This is a .NET 8.0 web application for connect clients and various kinds of craftsmen. The app uses an MSSQL database and Entity Framework to deal with data. 
(During development I use the official MSSQL Docker image.) The project includes Identity for user handling.
The unit test project uses NUnit and Moq, for integration testing I used xUnit. Based on the tests I have set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI.

At this moment I work on the React frontend.
