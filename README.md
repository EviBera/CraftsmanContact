## Craftman Contact

#### Pet project

This is a .NET 8.0 web application for connect clients and various kinds of craftmen. The app uses an MSSQL database and Entity Framework to deal with data. 
(During development I use the official MSSQL Docker image.)

At this moment I work on the backend, later I will add frontend to the project as well.
